  "WHAT A BRANCH IS TOLD ABOUT A TURN THAT DID NOT FINISH (karamazov-o4wm.2).

  A turn ends three ways short of its journal row: the beam cancels it at
  the deadline, the process dies under it, or it never got past the model
  call. The forfeit kept the pre-turn branch, so the call the model made was
  gone from its own tape, no row existed, and the only word it got was
  `abandoned`. If that call was a mutating shell — a deploy, a push, a test
  run that writes — its effect is unknown and the model no longer knows what
  it called, so the natural next move is to make the call again, which is
  the one unsafe thing. Floatboat's turn runner states the invariant as
  `interruption does not roll back committed side effects` and hands the
  next turn the tool, its status and its side-effect state; this is that.

  Mechanism only. What the journal holds about the turn — a row, a dispatch
  note the loop wrote before running the tool, or nothing — decides the
  shape; the retry-safe allowlist (wordlists.edn) decides the side-effect
  state; every sentence is prompts/turn-interrupted.md and
  prompts/uncertain-effect.md."

              what came back, and word that the turn stopped there.
  `dispatch`  the dispatch note, when the tool was in flight: the branch gets
              the call it made and its side-effect state — unknown, or
              no-effect for a read it may simply make again.
  neither     a deadline that landed during the model call keeps the plain
              deadline message; a crash with nothing on record adds nothing.

  `why` is :deadline or :crash; `seconds` the deadline. Every message is
