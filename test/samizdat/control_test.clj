  "Steering a running agent from the REPL. A human submits a directive against
  the run's db; the loop drains it at the next boundary and the arbiter injects
  it into the branch's next turn at priority zero, above every machine gate.
  The specification test drives a real run and asserts a REPL steer lands in
  the model's context."
