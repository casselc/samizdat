  "The pure decisions behind gui.core's fetch/scroll wiring — extracted so
  they are testable without loading a toolkit: glimmer/GTK deps live only
  under the :gui alias, so the suite stays headless and cannot require
  gui.core itself. Each fn answers one review-2026-08-2 finding:
  scroll-props #6, refetch-after? #7, tail-target #8.")

(defn scroll-props
  "Props for the inspector's :scrolled wrapper. `:scroll-top` belongs ONLY
  on the render that follows a selection change: glimmer-gtk's scrolled
  spec resets the adjustment whenever the prop is present (the value is
  ignored), and the reconciler re-applies the full prop map on every
  render — with the prop always present, every poller batch (≤1.5s), hover
  change or draft keystroke yanked a long turn log back to the top
  mid-read (review2 #6). `prev` is the selection the previous render saw;
  the caller memoizes it."

(defn refetch-after?
  "Whether a fetch that just completed for `fetch-sel` should re-run for a
  recorded pending selection. When the single-flight CAS in
  refresh-branch-log! fails, the new selection's fetch is not dropped — it
  is recorded as pending, and the in-flight fetch's finally re-runs for it
  (review2 #7); without that, the in-flight fetch discarded its own result
  (selection moved), the CAS loser was discarded, and on a finished run no
  poller event ever re-triggered — the panel read `(loading …)` forever.
  The same selection must NOT re-run: that is the busy guard's coalescing,
  which exists so a poller firing every second for one branch queues
  exactly one fetch."

(defn tail-target
  "Which run to tail after a run-list refresh. nil means keep tailing
  whatever is currently tailed. An EMPTY list is `don't know`, not `no
  runs` (review2 #8): list-runs answers {:ok false} — no throw — on a dead
  or busy server, and treating that as `no runs` disconnected the run
  being tailed (worst case right after start-new-run!, while the run was
  actively spending) and wiped the graph."
